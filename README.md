Password Generator

In the world of tech, the privacy of sensitive information is crucial for users and developers alike. A secure access to such information can ensure the safety of a user's identity as well as the identity of corporations. 

For this project, a starter code in Javascript was manipulated to create a random password generator. The features of this generator meets certain criteria for a secure password that allows a user to:

1. Pick the length of their password.
2. Choose the type of criteria they would like to have in their password. 

As I was working on this project, I learned that organizing my variables in Javascript on the global and local scope made the execution of my functions a lot neater. I also learned that logging my functions onto the console was a great way to check the functionality of my "if" statements. 

The challenge I faced in this project was being aware of my syntax errors in my variables and punctuations, since they affected my function execution. The console on my browser was useful in helping locate these errors. Additionally, I had to modify one of my global variables to ensure that the numeric criteria was met since the generated password did not include them sometimes. Overall, I think this project was an interesting practice for my Javascript skills for functions.
